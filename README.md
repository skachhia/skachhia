<!-- ### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ -->

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am @skachhia, a Full stack engineer with an overall experience of 7+ years including 5+ years as Java Software Engineer and 4+ years as Web Engineer with proven track record of successfully delivering more than 5 projects.

A curious soul always intrigued by tech, my interest was piqued while working at Aindra where I was responsible for building projects from the ground up, leveraging in house AI platforms for face, text, object detection and cervical cancer cell detection.

After moving to Webonise Lab, I realised my flair towards front-end technology, and committed as a Full stack engineer (React and Java) and now excited to take up a leadership role. I have already started participating in the staffing activities and trained more than 20 new recruits on React, GraphQL and Spring framework.
