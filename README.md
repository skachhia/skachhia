<!-- ### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ -->

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am @skachhia, a Full-Stack engineer with an overall experience of 7+ years including 5 years as a Java Software Engineer and 3 years as a Web Engineer with a proven track record of successfully delivering more than 5 projects.

A curious soul always intrigued by tech, my interest was piqued while working at Aindra where I was responsible for building projects from the ground up, leveraging in house AI platforms for face, text, object detection and cervical cancer cell detection.

After moving to Webonise Lab, I realised my flair for front end technologies as well, hence committed as a Full-Stack engineer (Java and React) and now further looking to enhance my leadership skills. In the process, I have already started participating in the staffing activities and trained more than 20 new recruits on React, GraphQL and Spring frameworks.
